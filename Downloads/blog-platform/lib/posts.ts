Web development has evolved tremendously over the past few years. In this post, we'll explore the latest trends and technologies that are shaping the future of web development.

## The Rise of Full-Stack Frameworks

Modern frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, and SvelteKit have revolutionized how we build web applications. These frameworks provide:

- **Server-side rendering** for better SEO and performance
- **API routes** for building full-stack applications
- **File-based routing** for intuitive project structure
- **Built-in optimization** for images, fonts, and more

## Key Technologies to Learn

1. **React/Vue/Svelte** - Component-based UI libraries
2. **TypeScript** - Type safety for JavaScript
3. **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
4. **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for backend development

The future of web development is bright, and there's never been a better time to start learning!`,

    content: `# The Art of Writing Clean Code

Clean code is not just about making your code workâ€”it's about making it readable, maintainable, and elegant. Here are some principles every developer should follow.

## Principles of Clean Code

### 1. Meaningful Names
Choose names that reveal intent. Your code should read like well-written prose.

\`\`\`javascript
// Bad
const d = new Date();
const u = users.filter(u => u.a);

// Good
const currentDate = new Date();
const activeUsers = users.filter(user => user.isActive);
\`\`\`

### 2. Functions Should Do One Thing
Keep your functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

### 3. Comments Should Explain Why, Not What
Good code is self-documenting. Use comments to explain the reasoning behind complex decisions.

## Conclusion

Writing clean code is a skill that develops over time. Practice these principles consistently, and your code will become more maintainable and enjoyable to work with.`,
